# OOC-Event-Classes

Swift classes I created for GSoC18.

Originally created for [AnitaB.org Open Source](https://github.com/anitab-org) to be used with their mobile game, PowerUp ([iOS](https://github.com/anitab-org/powerup-iOS), [Android](https://github.com/anitab-org/powerup-android)). The PowerUp project has since been archived.
